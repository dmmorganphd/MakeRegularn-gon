This notebook has been created with Mathematica Commercial License L3302-6545. 

Generates a regular polygon of n-sides, in which n is user-chosen.

The pdf of the same name is the default output. 

The txt of the same name is the product of: 
	pdftotext -layout Make\ Regular\ n-gon.pdf
from which the source code should be extractable. 

I'm in the process of figuring out how to get around github making a 
mess of .nb files on downloading. #totalgitnewbie. Hmm. Is that what pull 
requests are for?
